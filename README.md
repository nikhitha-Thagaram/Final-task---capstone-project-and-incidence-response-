📌 Capstone Project – Web Application Penetration Testing (DVWA)
📄 Overview

This project focuses on performing a Web Application Penetration Test on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) and simulating an Incident Response Process.
The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them in a controlled environment, collect evidence, and document the findings with proper mitigation steps.

🛠 Tools Used

Kali Linux

DVWA

Nmap

Gobuster / Dirsearch

Burp Suite

Sqlmap

Linux Utilities (UFW, systemctl, logs)

📌 Project Steps

Planning – Defined scope, objectives, tools, and DVWA setup.

Reconnaissance – Nmap scan, directory brute-forcing, technology fingerprinting.

Vulnerability Analysis – XSS, SQLi, Command Injection, CSRF, File Upload issues.

Exploitation – Demonstrated attacks with screenshots and outputs.

Incident Response Simulation

Detected the attack via logs

Contained it (blocking IP, stopping services)

Eradicated & applied fixes

Wrote Post-Incident Report
